    Truthy and Falsy Values
        Falsy values are not exactly false values, but will become false when we try to convert them into a boolean.
        5 falsy values: 0, '', undefined, NaN, null
        
        Everything else are so called truthy values. values that will be converted to true, for example,
any number that is not zero or any string that is not an empty string will be converted to true when we attempt to convert them to a boolean.
